# bootstrap

##############
ISSUES
##############
1. vertical-align: middle doesn't work when putting the style in CSS. Workaround to put style in every td location.


###############
THINGS REQUIRED
###############
1. = Time 
	- DONE HOWEVER MAY NOT BE VERY ARTISTIC
2. Time/date drop down
3. Modal form for info/edit/print
4. How to continuously refresh the screen?
	- See http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/getting_started/article.php/3479551
		- This one kills the modal!!!!
	- These two seem better:

	- http://www.9lessons.info/2009/07/auto-load-refresh-every-10-seconds-with.html
5. Sortable table
